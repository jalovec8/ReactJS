First, you must install Node.JS
- visit page: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Check the version of node.js by typing `node -v` in terminal.
Choose directory where you want to have the project.

To create project type ( where `my-app` is name of the project):
```
npm install create-react-app
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
cd "directory of your react project"
npm start
```

This will open browser on `localhost:3000`, then you can start programming!

### Good luck !
